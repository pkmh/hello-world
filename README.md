# Hello World
The obligatory "Hello, World!" program many times over

## General
I'm creating this repo as a sort of public sandbox. Essentially, I'm trying to broaden my horizons as a programmer and I thought it would be a good idea to track install instructions, track running instructions, and have a way to compare basic syntax across languages. Additionally, I'd like this repo to function as a "fiddle" environment for all of these different languages I'm learning about. I know this will help me, and I hope it helps someone else too!

As a quick note, I am starting this on February 3 2023 on a M2 Max MacBook Pro using MacOS Ventura 13.2 - as such, some of these instructions and notes may be specific to MacOS and/or my machine. I'll try to keep install instructions as generic as possible, but if you are not using MacOS please take special care and use your best judgement.
