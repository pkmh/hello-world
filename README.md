# Hello World
The obligatory "Hello, World!" program many times over

## General
I'm creating this repo as a sort of public sandbox. Essentially, I'm trying to broaden my horizons as a programmer and I thought it would be a good idea to track install/running instructions and have a way to compare basic notes about different languages. Additionally, I'd like this repo to function as a "fiddle" environment for all of these different languages I'm learning about. I know this will help me, and I hope it helps someone else too!

As a quick note, I am starting this on February 3 2023 on a M2 Max MacBook Pro using MacOS Ventura 13.2 - as such, some of these instructions and notes will be specific to MacOS and/or my machine. I'll try to keep install instructions as generic as possible, but if you are not using MacOS please take special care and use your best judgement.

## Local Env Setup
Since I am doing this on a brand new machine, I will also include some system setup instructions that match my current preferences

1. [Install iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)
2. [Install Git & Configure your Credentials](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)
3. [Install VSCODE as an editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - Launch the app and pick a them by going to `Settings > Theme > Color Theme`. Personally I like "Solarized Dark"
