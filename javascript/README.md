## Basics
(1) To start, install the latest LTS version of `"Node.js"` via the [official Node installer](https://nodejs.org/en/).
(2) Looking at this file directory, you will see a `package.json` file. You can think of this as the control center of a javascript project - it defines all of the necessary information about the project, as well as necessary dependencies & commands that can be run using NPM (i.e. Node Package Manager).
    (a) This is unnecessary for this project, but if you are creating a new project simply do the following in terminal: 
        - `mkdir <project-name>` => creates a new directory using the project name you specify
        - `cd <project-name>`    => move into that directory within your terminal window
        - `npm run init`         => creates a new Node.js project. NPM will walk you through this, just follow the prompts

## Commands
(1) `cd ./javascript`
(2) `npm i`
(3) `npm run hello`
